# timewatch

Known issues:
* Doesn't handle holidays at all (does handle fri/sat)
* Doesn't sign the doc (I suggest you do it manually after reviewing there are no bugs in the report).
* it'll overwrite any manually/automatically reported events, including vacation/sick days you reported prior to running the script for the specific month
